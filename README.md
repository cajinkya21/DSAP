		This is the project of encrypting and decrypting the file using AES algorithm. The AES algorithm is used because it is more secure than any other algorithms.Here in this project the AES charts means the algorithm uses the chars for mixing the original data into key and to form cipher text. First i try to get the input a normal text file in any format i.e tabular, simple, sheet etc. then I used the aes algoritm for making the plain text unreadble i.e the cipher text, then I put that data into a file and close it.It is an wonderful exprience while making this project.
